The project has been built using Node.js using the 'socket.io' package. This chat works the same as various other common chatapps today like WatsApp. The person using the chatapp will be first directed to a page where he/she will be ased to enter the name and mention the room name. The people belonging to the same room, will be able to chat with each other. The app can be used by more than two people at a time and the people can join different room (that is chat groups). People of a group cannot send or view the chats of the people of the other groups. Also, a person can send his or her current location when required. When a new person joing the group all the other people of the group except the new joined person are informed of the new person. When a person leaves a room/group, the other members of the group are informed that that particular person has left the group chat.
